# Manipolation_Merge_Datasets_python

 - I am going to find out who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts.
 - I read in, cleaned up, and visualized the real-world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub). With almost 30,000 commits and a history spanning over ten years, Scala is a mature language.

The dataset we will use, which has been previously mined and extracted from GitHub, is comprised of three files:

pulls_2011-2013.csv contains the basic information about the pull requests, and spans from the end of 2011 up to (but not including) 2014. pulls_2014-2018.csv contains identical information, and spans from 2014 up to 2018. pull_files.csv contains the files that were modified by each pull request. 
## concatenating tables and cleaning the data
## merging tables and answer to these questions
- Is the project still actively maintained?
- Is there camaraderie in the project?
- What files were changed in the last ten pull requests?
- Who made the most pull requests to a given file?
- Who made the last ten pull requests on a given file?
- The pull requests of two special developers
- measure experience by the number of pull requests of each developer
